# Final Project 

## Purpose and Goal
The purpose of the final project is 

- a. to recap the most important topics of the course
- b. to have the chance to explore topics we have not covered in class

The goal of the project is for you to have a nice project to show off when you apply for jobs!


## Requirements
### Basics
- A single page application created with React (with some interactive elements)
- A responsive layout (mobile and desktop)
- Styling with CSS or a library
- A project tracker of some kind (git hub project board, trello)


### Advanced
- One or some third party API calls
- A backend of some kind. Depending on the app this can be:
    - A express server and mongo db
    - Using a service such as supabase or appwrite. This is useful if you want to add user authentication. See links below
    - For a small app with a small amount of data, the local storage in the browser can also be enough.
  
### Nice to haves
- Automated tests (**Highly recommended**)
- Git Hub actions (to run tests after a push)


## Workflow
### Week 1: 
- Find your project idea
- Define the MVP (minimum to build for a viable product)
- Research solutions for features of your app
- Create the first user stories
- Create a mock up

GOAL: Get a green light on your idea by a teacher

### Week 2 - 6
- Build and test the project
- Plan each week on the monday: What is the focus to build this week, what do you need to research to succeed?

### Week 7
- Remove any last bugs
- Increase the test coverage
- Deploy the project (if applicable)

### Week 8 (two days)
